# Realtime Eye-Blink Detection Module (IEIE 2024)

This repository provides the eye-blink detection module that was part of the paper:  
**"Study on Facial Composite Feature Analysis for Determining Subject Anxiety Levels on Low-Power Computing Modules"**,  
presented at the **Summer Annual Conference of IEIE, 2024**.

This module focuses specifically on detecting eye blinks in real time as a key physiological signal for estimating subject anxiety levels. The full system was designed to operate efficiently on low-power edge devices, such as embedded boards and real-time camera setups.
